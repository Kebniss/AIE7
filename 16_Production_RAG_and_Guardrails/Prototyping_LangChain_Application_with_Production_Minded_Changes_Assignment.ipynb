        "\n",
        "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
        "\n",
        "Consider:\n",
        "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**: memory (RAM) is most costly but storing in disk takes more time and it might make the cache not be fast enough vs live inference\n",
        "- **Cache invalidation strategies**: We are talking about how to decide which cached info to remove to make space for a new item. We could use a mixed strategy of both RAM and disk to have most space. LRU - least recently used: pull out the one that has been used the most time ago. LFU - Least Frequently used: . FIFO - First in First Out. TTL - Time To Live: we don't want the cache to become stale\n",
        "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
        "- **Cache size management**\n",
        "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory vs Performance Trade-offs: The caching approach faces fundamental limitations around storage choices. Memory (RAM) caching provides instant access but is expensive and volatile, while disk caching offers persistence and capacity but introduces latency that may negate the speed benefits. This creates a challenging optimization problem where we must balance cost, performance, and data persistence based on your specific use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cache Management Complexity: Production systems must grapple with sophisticated cache invalidation strategies (LRU, LFU, TTL, FIFO) that each have different trade-offs for different scenarios. Additionally, concurrent access patterns can create race conditions and cache stampedes, while cache size management requires careful monitoring to prevent memory pressure or disk space issues. Cold start scenarios also present challenges where empty caches lead to poor initial user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Production Applicability: This caching approach is most valuable for high-traffic production applications with repetitive queries and stable knowledge bases, particularly when API costs are a concern. However, it's less suitable for real-time applications requiring fresh data, low-traffic systems where overhead isn't justified, or memory-constrained environments. The approach works well for the student loan document example in the notebook but would need significant enhancements for enterprise-scale deployments requiring distributed caching, adaptive TTL strategies, and comprehensive monitoring systems.\n",

            "Query: What are the common repayment timelines for California?\n",
            "\n",
            "🔄 Helpful Agent Response:\n",
            "In California, the repayment timelines can vary depending on the type of debt:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Foreclosure**: California does not have a post-sale redemption period for non-judicial foreclosures, which are the most common type. Once the property is sold at the trustee sale, the borrower does not have the right to reclaim it by paying off the debt. The foreclosure process can be lengthy and complex, with specific deadlines and procedures that must be followed ([source](https://sternberglawgroup.com/key-deadlines-in-the-foreclosure-timeline-in-california/)).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Credit Card Debt**: The statute of limitations for credit card debt in California is four years. This means that a creditor or collection agency has four years from the date of the last payment to take legal action to collect the debt. If a payment is made or an agreement to make a payment is signed within this period, the clock could start again ([source](https://www.incharge.org/understanding-debt/credit-card/what-is-statute-of-limitations-all-50-states/)).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Student Loan Debt**: Nationwide, the average student loan takes 20 years to repay. However, specific repayment timelines can vary depending on the type of loan and the borrower's financial situation ([source](https://dcba.lacounty.gov/student-loan-debt/)).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Debt Collection**: In California, there is generally a four-year limit for filing a lawsuit to collect a debt based on a written agreement. However, a partial payment of the debt may restart the clock ([source](https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/general/debt-collectors)).\n",
            "\n",

        "##### ❓ Question #2: Agent Architecture Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Compare the Simple Agent vs Helpfulness Agent architectures:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **When would you choose each agent type?**\n",
        "   - Simple Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
        "      - is faster and less expensive to run on average but responses could be more imprecise or incomplete due to the limited context it retrieved at the first pass. The risk of hallucination is also higher\n",
        "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
        "      - It is significantly slower and pricier to run but responses are more complete, contain more information including sources\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Production Considerations:**\n",
        "   - How does the helpfulness check affect latency?\n",
        "      - It increases latency greatly. In the sample query I ran it more than doubled the time to get the response\n",
        "   - What are the cost implications of iterative refinement?\n",
        "      - it means more calls to llm and other apis, eg Tavily, therefore it is pricier to run\n",
        "   - How would you monitor agent performance in production?\n",
        "      - I would check the average number of calls from the helpful node back to the agent node. If this happens too often I would investigate the quality of the retrieval, the RAG prompt and I would do further testing on the agent LLM. I would also sample a few answers weekly from the app and do QA on them. I would monitor latency metrics and other error statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scalability Questions:**\n",
        "   - How would these agents perform under high concurrent load?\n",
        "      - The performance of these LangGraph agents under high concurrent load is primarily constrained by the latency and rate limits of external services, particularly the OpenAI API. The RAG system's vector store can also become a significant bottleneck if it's not optimized for concurrent access. To mitigate these issues and ensure the system remains responsive and scalable, key strategies include implementing asynchronous operations to handle I/O efficiently, horizontally scaling the agents across multiple instances with a load balancer, and introducing a caching layer to reduce redundant and costly API calls.\n",
        "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
        "      - For both agents, caching LLM calls and tool outputs would be useful to reduce latency and cost. For the Simple Agent, we could cache both cache in input (query and returned embeddings) and in output (query and generated answer). The more complex Helpful Agent could have an extra layer of caching: in addition to basic caching, we could also cache the final, verified response after it has passed the helpfulness check. This advanced strategy ensures that only high-quality, refined answers are reused, bypassing the entire expensive verification and refinement process for subsequent identical queries.\n",
        "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
        "      - To implement rate limiting, you should wrap external API calls (like to OpenAI or Tavily) with a retry mechanism featuring exponential backoff, which gracefully re-attempts requests when a rate limit error occurs, waiting longer between each attempt. This handles temporary service throttling. For more persistent issues, such as a service being completely unavailable, you would use the circuit breaker pattern. This pattern monitors for consecutive failures and, after a set threshold, \"opens\" the circuit to make all subsequent calls fail instantly without hitting the network, preventing your application from wasting resources on a service that is down. These two patterns work together: retries handle transient issues, while circuit breakers protect against prolonged outages.\n"

        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",

        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
        "\n",

        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",

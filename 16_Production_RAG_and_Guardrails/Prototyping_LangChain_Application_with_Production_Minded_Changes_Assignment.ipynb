        "\n",
        "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
        "\n",
        "Consider:\n",
        "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**: memory (RAM) is most costly but storing in disk takes more time and it might make the cache not be fast enough vs live inference\n",
        "- **Cache invalidation strategies**: We are talking about how to decide which cached info to remove to make space for a new item. We could use a mixed strategy of both RAM and disk to have most space. LRU - least recently used: pull out the one that has been used the most time ago. LFU - Least Frequently used: . FIFO - First in First Out. TTL - Time To Live: we don't want the cache to become stale\n",
        "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
        "- **Cache size management**\n",
        "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory vs Performance Trade-offs: The caching approach faces fundamental limitations around storage choices. Memory (RAM) caching provides instant access but is expensive and volatile, while disk caching offers persistence and capacity but introduces latency that may negate the speed benefits. This creates a challenging optimization problem where we must balance cost, performance, and data persistence based on your specific use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cache Management Complexity: Production systems must grapple with sophisticated cache invalidation strategies (LRU, LFU, TTL, FIFO) that each have different trade-offs for different scenarios. Additionally, concurrent access patterns can create race conditions and cache stampedes, while cache size management requires careful monitoring to prevent memory pressure or disk space issues. Cold start scenarios also present challenges where empty caches lead to poor initial user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Production Applicability: This caching approach is most valuable for high-traffic production applications with repetitive queries and stable knowledge bases, particularly when API costs are a concern. However, it's less suitable for real-time applications requiring fresh data, low-traffic systems where overhead isn't justified, or memory-constrained environments. The approach works well for the student loan document example in the notebook but would need significant enhancements for enterprise-scale deployments requiring distributed caching, adaptive TTL strategies, and comprehensive monitoring systems.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Standard Repayment Plan: New borrowers are typically placed on the Standard Repayment Plan, which offers fixed payments over a 10-year period.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Income-Driven Repayment Plans: If borrowers have difficulty making payments, they may enroll in Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, which adjust payments based on income and family size, potentially extending the repayment period.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Average Repayment Duration: On average, student loan borrowers take about 20 years to repay their student loans fully.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Payment Resumption: After the COVID-19 federal student loan payment pause, payments resumed on October 1, 2024, with interest accruing from September 1, 2023.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Monthly Billing: Borrowers receive monthly bills at least 21 days before the due date, and those using auto-debit may receive an interest rate deduction.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the typical repayment timeline is around 10 years under the standard plan, but many borrowers take longer, averaging about 20 years, especially if using income-driven plans or facing repayment challenges.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
        "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",

        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",

        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",

For example, some complaints mention not being notified when loans were transferred between companies or when repayment was supposed to restart, leading to unintentional delinquencies.\\n\\n2. **Difficulty in Managing Payment Plans:** Several complainants reported that their servicers did not offer flexible repayment options or did not help them reevaluate their payments based on their financial situations. This made it challenging for borrowers to meet their repayment obligations.\\n\\n3. **Financial Hardships and Unmanageable Interest:** Borrowers described prolonged financial hardships, stagnant wages, or economic downturns, making it impossible to afford payments. Additionally, high interest accumulation, especially during deferment or forbearance periods, increased the total debt burden, discouraging full repayment.\\n\\n4. **Issues with Loan Servicing and Processing:** Complaints include problems like incorrect billing, mismanagement of repayment plans, or inability to apply extra payments correctly. These issues can prevent borrowers from reducing principal balances or paying off loans more quickly.\\n\\n5. **Unfair or Predatory Practices:** Some borrowers felt the repayment process was intentionally designed to keep them in debt longer, with loan servicers applying extra funds primarily toward interest or not allowing straightforward payoffs.\\n\\n6. **External Economic Factors:** Recessions, job loss, and other economic hardships often limited borrowers’ ability to make payments, compounded by loan interest and fees that continued to grow even during periods of hardship.\\n\\nIn summary, failures to pay back loans were often driven by a lack of transparency, insufficient support from lenders, economic difficulties, and interest that compounded rapidly, making repayment an insurmountable challenge for many borrowers.'"

Some paid more than they owed or saw balances increase despite making payments.\\n\\n5. **Financial Hardships and Unforeseen Circumstances:** Many borrowers faced job loss, medical issues, or economic hardships, which made repayment difficult or impossible, especially when combined with interest accumulation and poor communication from servicers.\\n\\n6. **Systemic Failures and Lack of Support:** The system\\'s opacity, transfers between servicers, and inadequate support or guidance from loan providers hampered borrowers’ efforts to manage or refinance their loans effectively.\\n\\nIn summary, the primary reasons for loan repayment failure included misinformation, mismanagement by servicers, predatory practices, accumulation of interest during difficult times, and systemic issues that prevented borrowers from accessing or understanding available repayment options.'"

This lack of communication sometimes led to missed payments and delinquency notices appearing unexpectedly.\\n\\n2. **Complex and Opaque Servicing Practices:** Borrowers reported difficulty understanding their loan balances, interest accrual, and their options for repayment or deferment. Repeated steering into forbearance instead of income-driven repayment plans, often without full disclosure, increased their debt burden due to accruing interest.\\n\\n3. **Inaccurate or Poor Reporting:** Many experienced incorrect reporting of their account status—such as being marked delinquent when their accounts were current—leading to drops in credit scores and associated financial hardships.\\n\\n4. **Difficulty Accessing Assistance or Proper Options:** Borrowers often found that their options, such as income-driven repayment plans or loan forgiveness, were not explained or offered, or were hard to access due to technical issues or mismanagement.\\n\\n5. **Mismanagement and unethical practices:** Several complaints highlighted improper handling of accounts, unauthorized transfer of loans, and misapplication of payments, which further complicated repayment efforts.\\n\\n6. **Financial Hardship and Unforeseen Circumstances:** Economic hardships, unemployment, health issues, and unforeseen financial crises made it difficult for some borrowers to keep up with payments, especially when options for relief were not effectively communicated or accessible.\\n\\nIn summary, many borrowers failed to pay back their loans because of systemic failures in communication, management, and servicing practices, compounded by financial hardships and a lack of transparent, accessible options to manage or discharge their debt.'"

If the threshold is too high it might lead to the creation of too many small chunks that are very close in content and will cause context repetition in the vector store. Another possible outcome is that if the threshold is too low then the algorithm will produce few very large chunks and grouping different FAQs together. This would degrade retrieval as one query might return a very large chunk of data with multiple irrelevant FAQs. We could mitigate this by adding a chunk splitting rule based on the structure of the document: eg extracting based on keywords like \"Question\" and \"Answer\" or paragraphs or sentences"

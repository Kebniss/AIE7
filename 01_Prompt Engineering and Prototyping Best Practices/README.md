## ✨ Enhanced Features & Improvements

This project has been supercharged with a range of new features to provide a robust, seamless, and engaging user experience. Here's a look at what's new:

### 🚀 Backend Improvements

Our FastAPI backend is now more powerful and resilient.

#### **Multi-Turn Chat Support**
- **Endpoint:** `/api/chat-messages`
- **Functionality:** Accepts an array of messages (`role`: system/user/assistant, `content`: text) to maintain full conversation context with OpenAI.
- **Streaming:** Supports real-time, streaming responses for a dynamic chat experience.
- **Compatibility:** Backward compatible with the original `/api/chat` endpoint.

#### **Robust Error Handling**
- **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Handles invalid/missing API keys, rate limiting, network errors, malformed requests, and server errors.
- **Clear Messages:** Provides detailed, actionable error messages to help you troubleshoot with ease.

### 🎨 Frontend Features

The frontend has been rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on a clean, modern, and responsive "vaporwave" aesthetic.

#### **Modern Chat Interface**
- **UI:** A sleek, responsive interface with a side panel for settings.
- **Real-Time Responses:** Watch the AI's responses stream in real-time.
- **Markdown Support:** Full support for rich text formatting, including bold, italics, code blocks, and lists.
- **Session Management:** Start new chats, maintain full conversation history, and enjoy automatic scrolling to the latest message.

#### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Intuitive Message Input:**
  - `Enter`: Send message
  - `Shift+Enter` / `Alt+Enter`: New line
  - Auto-expanding textarea for longer messages.
- **Persistent System Prompt:** An optional, editable prompt that persists across messages in the same chat session.
- **Clear Feedback:** "AI is typing..." indicator and disabled inputs during processing to keep you informed.

#### **Advanced Error Handling & Recovery**
- **User-Friendly Alerts:** Clear, visual error messages for issues like invalid API keys, network problems, or rate limits.
- **Actionable Steps:** Instructions to help you recover from errors and retry.

### 🛡️ Security & Best Practices
- **API Key Security:** Your API key is stored only in the frontend's state and is never persisted.
- **Secure Requests:** CORS is enabled for secure cross-origin communication.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitization and validation of user inputs.
- **Reliability:** Proper error boundaries and fallbacks to prevent crashes.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- **System Prompt:** Use the optional system prompt to guide the AI's behavior (e.g., "You are a helpful coding assistant").
- **Chat Features:** Use `Shift+Enter` for new lines, format your messages with Markdown, and click "New Chat" to start a new conversation.
- **Error Recovery:** If you encounter an error, check your API key, network connection, or wait a few seconds if you've been rate-limited.

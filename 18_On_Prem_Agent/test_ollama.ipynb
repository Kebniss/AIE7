      "I need to find the cube root of 27. The cube root is a number that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives you the original number. So for 27, I need a number x such that x * x * x = 27.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about what numbers multiply to get 27 with multiplication done three times. First, I know that 3 cubed is 3*3*3=27. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me make sure there aren't other possibilities. Since it's a cube root, and cubes can be positive or negative for real numbers? No, actually, the cube root of a number can be negative if the original number is negative, but here 27 is positive, so the cube root should also be positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me confirm: If I take -3, that would be (-3)*(-3)=9, and then 9*(-3)=-27. So for positive numbers like 27, the real cube root is positive, but there might be complex roots if we're considering all possibilities, but usually, when people say \"the cube root,\" they mean the real principal cube root.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question says \"the 3rd root,\" which I assume means cube root. And it's asking for a numerical value, so probably just the real number.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, x * x * x = 27\n",
      "\n",
      "I can write this as x^3 = 27\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, to find x, I take both sides to the power of one-third: (x^3)^(1/3) = 27^(1/3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Which gives me x = ∛27\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, since 27 is a perfect cube, as 3*3*3=27, so ∛27 should be exactly 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me double-check. What about other numbers? For example, if I take 9, that's not right because the cube root involves three factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe fractions or decimals, but no, since it's a perfect cube, it should be an integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can think in terms of exponents: ∛27 is the same as saying 27 to the power one-third.\n",
      "\n",
      "And 27^1/3 = (3^3)^{1/3} = 3^{3*(1/3)} = 3^1 = 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that confirms it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that cubes: (-5)^3 = -125, which is negative. For positive numbers, cube roots are always real and unique for the principal root.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for 27, x=3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question says \"the 3rd root,\" not specifying if it's integer or anything, but in this case, it should be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I should consider if there are any other interpretations. Like, maybe they mean something else? But no, cube root is standardly defined as the number that gives you back the original with three multiplications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some contexts, people might say \"cube root\" to mean square root or something, but here it's clearly 3rd root.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third root of a number means raising it to one-third power.\n",
      "\n",
      "So ∛27 = (1/343) no, that's not right. Let me think about the notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, cube root is denoted by ∛ or sometimes just as x^{1/3}.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, I think 3 is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me verify with a calculator if possible, but since I'm doing it manually, let's see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that from 1 to 27, the numbers are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1^3 = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "2^3 = 8\n",
      "\n",
      "3^3 = 27\n",
      "\n",
      "4^3 = 64, which is larger than 27.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, between 2 and 3, but since it's exactly at integer point, no need for approximation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 27 is a cube of 3, the cube root must be 3 or possibly -3 if we consider real numbers with negative roots, but again, principal cube root is positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question doesn't specify principal, so technically there could be multiple roots in complex numbers, but I think for this context, it's straightforward and they want the real number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the way it's phrased, \"the 3rd root,\" likely implies the main one or the integer one if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, cube roots might not be integers, like ∛8=2, which is integer, but for example, ∛16 is between 2 and 3, since 2^3=8<16, 3^3=27>16.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here it's 27, so no issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I should write the answer properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the cube root of 27 is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question says \"the 3rd root,\" which might be a bit informal, but I think it means cube root.\n",
      "\n",
      "In mathematics, the nth root is often called the \"n-th root.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But here it's specified as third or something? No, it says \"3rd root\" probably meaning cube root.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes people say square root for second root, but rarely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I think 3 is the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be thorough, let me consider if there are any other real roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "The equation x^3 - 27 = 0 has only one real solution because it's a cubic with odd degree, so three real roots counting multiplicity? No, for cubes, in real numbers, every real number has exactly one cube root.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the cube root function is defined and unique for all real numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for x^3 - 27 =0, (x-3)(x^2 +3x+9)= something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, from earlier: x^3=27, so factors are not necessary unless factoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in terms of roots, it's just one real root at x=3.\n",
      "\n",
      "There might be complex roots if we consider the full set, but I think for this problem, it's overkill.\n",
      "\n",
      "So probably the answer is 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me read the question again: \"What is the 3rd root of 27?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, cube root.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps they mean something else by \"the\" third root? Like in some contexts, people might say \"the square root\" meaning principal or something, but here similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm overthinking it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer should be 3.\n",
